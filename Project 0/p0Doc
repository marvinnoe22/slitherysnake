Project 0: JavaScript game
In this project you will be writing a game for a website using JavaScript. 
The game can be as simple or complex as you want, but the game must be displayed on a webpage. Some helpful ideas for a game are:
- Tic-tac-toe
- Memory game (find matching cards, they flip back over if match not found)
- Checkers
- Battleship
Technical requirements
You must use the following technologies in the project:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
Also, you must use some kind of DOM manipulation to reflect the state of the game, 
and you should use event listeners to respond to user inputs.
Finally, you should style your page to facilitate good user experience. Some helpful tips:
- Don't use distracting backgrounds or animations
- Ensure an adequate contrast ratio so that the user can see any text, shapes, or images on the page
- Make it as easy as possible for the user to play your game
Some bonus requirements (not required):
- User can select 1 Player or 2 Player mode
- User can play against the computer
- User can set custom game settings before starting the game
- User can select the background color of the webpage
On the due date of the project you will give a 5 minute presentation where
 you show how the game works on the webpage, as well as explaining your code
  and how you built the game. Please adhere to this time limit.
